# Evil Hangman 

Evil Hangman is a version of Hangman where the computer cheats by holding off on selecting the "secret word" for as long as possible. Throughout the game, the computer tries to cheat its way into winning by maintaining as long a list of words as it can. The goal is for the user to run out of guesses before the computer is forced to commit to a "secret word."
